You can install RCapstone from github with:

Read and clean data
-------------------

This loads the earthquake data used for the graphs

Earthquakes in US and China after 2000
--------------------------------------

This graphs earthquakes in US and China after 2000; the radius of the circles charts the richter-scale magnitude of the earthquakes.

Labeled arthquakes in US and China after 2000
---------------------------------------------

This graphs earthquakes in US and China after 2000; the radius of the circles charts the richter-scale magnitude of the earthquakes. The largest earthquakes are labeled.

Map of earthquakes in Mexico
----------------------------

Generates a Map of earthquakes in Mexico after 2000. The radius of the circles corresponds to the magnitude of the earthquakes.
